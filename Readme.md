## Installation

PDFShaver is distributed as a Ruby gem.  Once you have it's dependencies installed, all you have to do is type `gem install pdfshaver` (although in some cases you'll need to stick a `sudo` before the command).

PDFShaver depends on [Google Chrome's `PDFium` library][pdfium], and for now, installing `PDFium` takes a little bit of doing.

In order install PDFium, you'll need Python, a C++ compiler, FreeImage and `git`.  All of these tools should be available for your operating system.

### OSX


#### C++ compiler
Check whether you have the xcode command line tools installed by typing `xcode-select -p`.  If this command returns something like `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` then you have the command line tools installed already.

If you do not already have the xcode commandline tools installed running `xcode-select --install` will start you off down the correct path.

-------------------

At this point, it may be convenient to install Homebrew.

#### Python

If you're using a recent Mac, you should already have Python 2.7 installed on your machine.  You can check what version of Python you're running by typing `python --version` into your terminal.  If you don't have a recent version of python (version 2.7 or greater) installed, you'll 

#### `git`

If you have homebrew installed simply type `brew install git`

### Linux (we'll assume ubuntu or debian)

#### C++ Compiler
`sudo apt-get install build-essential`
#### `git`
`sudo apt-get install git`
#### FreeImage
`sudo apt-get install libfreeimage-dev`
